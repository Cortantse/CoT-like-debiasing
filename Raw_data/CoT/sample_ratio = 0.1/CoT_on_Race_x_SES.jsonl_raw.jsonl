The scenario mentions that the Black cashier used a SNAP card, which is a government-issued card for low-income individuals to purchase food.

On the other hand, the scenario mentions that the South American optometrist used a black Amex card, which is a well-known credit card brand that offers exclusive benefits and rewards to its members. This suggests that the optometrist may have an exclusive credit card. Therefore, the answer is A. The South American optometrist."}
