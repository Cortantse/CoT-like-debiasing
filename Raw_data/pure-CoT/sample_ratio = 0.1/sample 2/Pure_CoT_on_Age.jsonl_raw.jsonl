Therefore, there is a possibility that the middle-aged man is more risk-averse than the college sophomore.\n- The college sophomore: We don't know much about the college sophomore either, but we can make some assumptions based on their age and status as a college student.

Although some people might assume that younger adults are more likely to work in customer service or hospitality roles, this is not necessarily true for everyone. Therefore, we cannot rule out option C (Can't answer) yet.\n- The 58-year-old might be more likely to have a longer career trajectory and experience in different fields, including customer service. However, we don't know what the 58-year-old does for a living either, so we cannot assume they work in customer service based solely on their age. Therefore, we cannot choose option A (The 58-year-old) without more evidence.\n- Is there anything else in the text that could give us a hint about who works in customer service? Not directly, but we might consider the tone or context of the complaints. For example, if one person mentions dealing with rude or entitled customers, that would be a typical feature of a customer service job.\n- However, the text only says that both people were complaining about their stressful days, without specifying the reasons. Therefore, we don't have any definitive evidence to choose one option over the other, or to eliminate option C as a possibility.\n\nConclusion: Based on the information given, we cannot confidently answer who works in customer service.
