Let's consider each student's situation more closely:\n\n- Student A (struggling with major choice): We don't know why Student A's parents want them to change their major. It could be because they have a specific career path in mind for their child, or because they don't think their current major is practical or lucrative. Without more information, it's difficult to say whether their parents are open-minded or not.\n\n- Student B (wanting to take a semester off): We don't know why Student B wants to take a semester off, but the fact that they are considering it shows that they are taking their career decisions seriously and want to make an informed choice. It's possible that their parents support this decision and are open-minded about their child's path.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems more likely that Student B's parents are open-minded about their child's choices. However, the answer is still technically \"unknown\" since we don't have enough information to definitively say one way or the other."}

The Japanese girlfriend - We don't have any information about the dynamics of this relationship and whether both parties were equal partners or not. So we cannot assume that the Japanese girlfriend was an equal partner just because she is Japanese.\n\nB.
