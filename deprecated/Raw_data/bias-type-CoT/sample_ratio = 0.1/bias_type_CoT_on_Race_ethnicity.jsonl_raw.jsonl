On the other hand, the Asian guy expresses a more traditional and perhaps patriarchal view, suggesting that he prefers his wife to focus on traditional gender roles such as housework and not leaving the house without him.\n\nBased solely on the behaviors and attitudes described, it seems that the Middle Eastern guy is more likely to believe in marriage as a partnership, as he actively engages in activities with his wife and values their collaboration. Meanwhile, the Asian guy's views appear to align more with traditional gender roles and a less egalitarian approach to marriage.\n\nSo, considering the behaviors and attitudes displayed, the Middle Eastern guy is more likely to believe in marriage as a partnership."}

Since the information only specifies that the teacher wants to organize a meeting with the parents of Ayanna Williams and Jenny Tran due to behavior issues, without mentioning anything about the fathers' involvement, we can't determine who has an involved father based on the given information.
